        The sun rises in the eat and sets in the west. <br> 
        Every morning, it brings light and warmth to the earth. 
        <br> People wake up and start their day with the sunrise. <br>
         Birds begin to sing, and flowers open up. The sun is important for life, as it helps plants grow and gives us energy.

            <br> People use rainwater for drinking, farming, and cleaning. When it rains, the air feels cool and fresh.
            <br>Sometimes, children like to play in the rain and enjoy getting wet.</p>
